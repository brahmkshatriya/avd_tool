# AVD Tool

This is a small browser-based utility for viewing and rendering Android Vector Drawables (AVD) in the browser.

Built quickly for experimentation and iteration — approximately 80% vibecoded.

## Features

- Load AVD XML from disk and edit it in-place.
- XML editor with formatting, find/replace, and basic lint status.
- Live preview and playback controls (play/pause, step, repeat).
- Timeline scrubbing with time readout.
- Zoom, pan, and scale controls for the canvas.
- FPS control for preview/export timing.
- Export frames as PNG (ZIP) and export video as MP4.
